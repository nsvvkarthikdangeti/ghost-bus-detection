# 🚍 Real-time Public Transit "Ghost Bus" Detector 👻

A real-time system that streams bus locations, compares them against schedule data (GTFS), and flags potential **ghost buses** (scheduled but missing/inactive vehicles). It ships with a live simulator, a FastAPI + WebSocket backend, and a React dashboard with map visualizations.

---

## ✨ Highlights

* **Live tracking** across multiple cities (e.g., Pune, Ratnagiri)
* **Ghost-bus detection** (inactive/missing vs schedule)
* **Interactive map** + stats dashboard + ID search
* **WebSockets** end-to-end: instant updates, no refresh
* **GTFS-aware** design: aligns live telemetry with scheduled trips/routes

---

## 🧭 Healthy vs Ghost Buses

* **Healthy buses** ✅ — vehicles that are active and moving, consistent with schedule (GTFS) and recent telemetry.
* **Ghost buses** ❌ — vehicles that are scheduled but **missing** or **inactive** (no new updates for a threshold window, off-route, or never appear). Rules live in detection logic and can be tuned per agency.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* React (Create React App)
* react-leaflet + leaflet (map)
* WebSocket client

**Backend**

* FastAPI (Python)
* Uvicorn (ASGI server)
* Redis (Pub/Sub + latest-vehicle state)

**Data**

* **GTFS** (General Transit Feed Specification) schedules for trips/routes/stops
* Live vehicle telemetry (simulated by `ingest_sim.py`)

---

## 📥 Prerequisites

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Node.js 18+** & **npm**
* **Redis** server running locally (or reachable remotely)

> Windows users: You can run Redis via WSL/Docker/Memurai. If you already have `redis-server` working, you’re good.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Windows / macOS / Linux)

Open **three** terminals (plus Redis). Paths shown are from the repo root `GHOSTBUS/`.

### 0) Start Redis

```powershell
# If available natively
redis-server
```

### 1) Start the vehicle simulator

```powershell
cd "backend app"
# (Optional) activate venv
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell
# source .venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux

pip install fastapi uvicorn redis
python ingest_sim.py
```

You should see lines like: `Published MH12_1234 (pune) ...` every \~2s.

### 2) Start the backend API/WebSocket server

**Option A (recommended, since `main.py` calls uvicorn for you):**

```powershell
cd "backend app"
python main.py
```

**Option B (run uvicorn module directly):**

```powershell
cd "backend app"
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Backend should report: `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3) Start the frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm install react-leaflet leaflet
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> The frontend connects to the backend WS at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/vehicles`. If you change the backend host/port, update it in `src/App.js`.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Simulator (`ingest_sim.py`)** publishes vehicle updates to Redis channel `vehicles:updates` and caches the latest state per vehicle in hashes (`vehicle:<id>`), with expiry.
2. **Backend (`main.py`)** subscribes to Redis Pub/Sub and relays each message to browser clients over **WebSocket** (`/ws/vehicles`).
3. **Frontend (React)** consumes the WS stream, normalizes fields, maintains an in-memory vehicle map, and renders markers on **Leaflet**. City filters/stats/search update live.
4. **Detection (`detection.py`)** holds the heuristics to flag **ghost buses** (e.g., no updates for X seconds, off-route vs GTFS, etc.). You can enrich this to check schedule adherence.

## 🧠 GTFS Integration Notes

* Place GTFS files (e.g., `stops.txt`, `routes.txt`, `trips.txt`, `stop_times.txt`, `calendar.txt`) in a folder such as `./gtfs/<agency>/`.
* Parse GTFS once at startup to build:

  * stop → (lat,lng)
  * route → trips
  * trip → ordered stop sequence with times
* During runtime, align incoming vehicle updates to their likely trip/shape and detect anomalies:

  * **Missing vehicles:** scheduled trips with no corresponding live updates
  * **Stale vehicles:** no position update for > threshold (e.g., 120s)
  * **Off-route:** distance from expected shape/stop sequence exceeds tolerance
* Keep this layer modular so you can swap simulators for real AVL feeds later.
